Eliza implements a simple therapist chatbot called "Eliza" that interacts with users through basic text-based conversations. The chatbot recognizes user inputs related to feelings, relationships, and verbs, and provides appropriate responses. The program uses Pythonâ€™s re library for regular expression matching and random for dynamic response generation. This project demonstrates basic natural language processing concepts like pattern matching and conditional dialogue generation.

Generating Plotting Data generates synthetic data to model the relationship between years of education and income, visualized using scatter plots. It demonstrates a positive linear correlation between the two variables, with varying levels of noise to illustrate how randomness impacts the clarity of the relationship. The project uses NumPy to generate the data and Matplotlib for plotting, showing how different noise scales affect the visibility of the linear trend.
